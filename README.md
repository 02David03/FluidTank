Add large tanks that can have up to 1048576 buckets of fluid.

You can store **only vanilla fluid** (water and lava) because forge is rewriting fluid API.

There are 7 tiers in this mod, Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, Diamond, Emerald and Star.
The capacity of wood tank is 4000 mB but star one can have 1048576000 mB.

~All tanks have Fluid Capability to transfer fluid and their items also have Fluid Capability for items.~
