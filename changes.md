FluidTank for 1.14.4 and Forge

**This mod requires [Scalable Cat's Force](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/scalable-cats-force) to work.**

**You have to download version 2.13.1 of [Scalable Cat's Force](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/scalable-cats-force).**
I don't support any other environment.

**This version requires forge newer than 28.1.0 (Forge Recommend version)**

## v14.8.0
- Update to new Scala (2.13.1) **Requires version 2.13.1 of library.**
- Added fluid pipe (BETA). Right click pipe to change mode. (No Connection -> Connected -> Input -> Output)  
  Fluids are transported from input to output.  
  Unlike BC's pipe, the pipe has no internal tank.
